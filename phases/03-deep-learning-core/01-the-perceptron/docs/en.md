# The Perceptron

> The perceptron is the atom of neural networks. Split it open and you find weights, a bias, and a decision.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 (Linear Algebra Intuition)
**Time:** ~60 minutes

## The Problem

You know vectors and dot products. You know that a matrix transforms inputs into outputs. But how does a machine *learn* which transformation to use?

The perceptron answers this. It's the simplest possible learning machine: take some inputs, multiply by weights, add a bias, and make a binary decision. Then adjust. That's it. Every neural network ever built is layers of this idea stacked together.

Understanding the perceptron means understanding what "learning" actually means in code: adjusting numbers until the output matches reality.

## The Concept

### One Neuron, One Decision

A perceptron takes n inputs, multiplies each by a weight, sums them up, adds a bias, and passes the result through an activation function.

```
Inputs        Weights

  x1 ────── w1 ──┐
                  │
  x2 ────── w2 ──┼──▶ Σ(wi·xi) + b ──▶ step(z) ──▶ output (0 or 1)
                  │
  x3 ────── w3 ──┘
                  │
           bias ──┘
```

The step function is brutal: if the weighted sum plus bias is >= 0, output 1. Otherwise, output 0.

```
step(z) = 1  if z >= 0
           0  if z < 0
```

This is a linear classifier. The weights and bias define a line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that splits the input space into two regions.

### The Decision Boundary

For two inputs, the perceptron draws a line through 2D space:

```
  x2
  ┤
  │  Class 1        /
  │    (0)          /
  │                /
  │               / w1·x1 + w2·x2 + b = 0
  │              /
  │             /     Class 2
  │            /        (1)
  ┼───────────/──────────── x1
```

Everything on one side of the line outputs 0. Everything on the other side outputs 1. Training moves this line until it correctly separates the classes.

### The Learning Rule

The perceptron learning rule is simple:

```
For each training example (x, y_true):
    y_pred = predict(x)
    error = y_true - y_pred

    For each weight:
        w_i = w_i + learning_rate * error * x_i
    bias = bias + learning_rate * error
```

If the prediction is correct, error = 0, nothing changes. If it predicts 0 but should be 1, weights increase. If it predicts 1 but should be 0, weights decrease. The learning rate controls how big each adjustment is.

### The XOR Problem

Here's where it breaks. Look at these logic gates:

```
AND gate:           OR gate:            XOR gate:
x1  x2  out         x1  x2  out         x1  x2  out
0   0   0           0   0   0           0   0   0
0   1   0           0   1   1           0   1   1
1   0   0           1   0   1           1   0   1
1   1   1           1   1   1           1   1   0
```

AND and OR are linearly separable: you can draw a single line to separate the 0s from the 1s. XOR is not. No single line can separate [0,1] and [1,0] from [0,0] and [1,1].

```
AND (separable):        XOR (not separable):

  x2                      x2
  1 ┤  0     1            1 ┤  1     0
    │     /                 │
  0 ┤  0 / 0              0 ┤  0     1
    ┼──/──────── x1         ┼──────────── x1
       line works!          no single line works!
```

This is a fundamental limit. A single perceptron can only solve linearly separable problems. Minsky and Papert proved this in 1969 and it nearly killed neural network research for a decade.

The fix: stack perceptrons into layers. A multi-layer perceptron can solve XOR by combining two linear decisions into a nonlinear one.

## Build It

### Step 1: The Perceptron class

```python
class Perceptron:
    def __init__(self, n_inputs, learning_rate=0.1):
        self.weights = [0.0] * n_inputs
        self.bias = 0.0
        self.lr = learning_rate

    def predict(self, inputs):
        total = sum(w * x for w, x in zip(self.weights, inputs))
        total += self.bias
        return 1 if total >= 0 else 0

    def train(self, training_data, epochs=100):
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            errors = 0
            for inputs, target in training_data:
                prediction = self.predict(inputs)
                error = target - prediction
                if error != 0:
                    errors += 1
                    for i in range(len(self.weights)):
                        self.weights[i] += self.lr * error * inputs[i]
                    self.bias += self.lr * error
            if errors == 0:
                print(f"Converged at epoch {epoch + 1}")
                return
        print(f"Did not converge after {epochs} epochs")
```

### Step 2: Train on logic gates

```python
and_data = [
    ([0, 0], 0),
    ([0, 1], 0),
    ([1, 0], 0),
    ([1, 1], 1),
]

or_data = [
    ([0, 0], 0),
    ([0, 1], 1),
    ([1, 0], 1),
    ([1, 1], 1),
]

not_data = [
    ([0], 1),
    ([1], 0),
]

print("=== AND Gate ===")
p_and = Perceptron(2)
p_and.train(and_data)
for inputs, _ in and_data:
    print(f"  {inputs} -> {p_and.predict(inputs)}")

print("\n=== OR Gate ===")
p_or = Perceptron(2)
p_or.train(or_data)
for inputs, _ in or_data:
    print(f"  {inputs} -> {p_or.predict(inputs)}")

print("\n=== NOT Gate ===")
p_not = Perceptron(1)
p_not.train(not_data)
for inputs, _ in not_data:
    print(f"  {inputs} -> {p_not.predict(inputs)}")
```

### Step 3: Watch XOR fail

```python
xor_data = [
    ([0, 0], 0),
    ([0, 1], 1),
    ([1, 0], 1),
    ([1, 1], 0),
]

print("\n=== XOR Gate (single perceptron) ===")
p_xor = Perceptron(2)
p_xor.train(xor_data, epochs=1000)
for inputs, expected in xor_data:
    result = p_xor.predict(inputs)
    status = "OK" if result == expected else "WRONG"
    print(f"  {inputs} -> {result} (expected {expected}) {status}")
```

It will never converge. This is the hard proof that a single perceptron cannot learn XOR.

### Step 4: Solve XOR with two layers

The trick: XOR = (x1 OR x2) AND NOT (x1 AND x2). Combine three perceptrons:

```
Layer 1:                    Layer 2:

  x1 ──┬── OR neuron ──────┐
       │                    ├── AND neuron ──▶ output
  x2 ──┴── NAND neuron ────┘
```

```python
def xor_network(x1, x2):
    or_neuron = Perceptron(2)
    or_neuron.weights = [1.0, 1.0]
    or_neuron.bias = -0.5

    nand_neuron = Perceptron(2)
    nand_neuron.weights = [-1.0, -1.0]
    nand_neuron.bias = 1.5

    and_neuron = Perceptron(2)
    and_neuron.weights = [1.0, 1.0]
    and_neuron.bias = -1.5

    hidden1 = or_neuron.predict([x1, x2])
    hidden2 = nand_neuron.predict([x1, x2])
    output = and_neuron.predict([hidden1, hidden2])
    return output


print("\n=== XOR Gate (multi-layer network) ===")
for inputs, expected in xor_data:
    result = xor_network(inputs[0], inputs[1])
    print(f"  {inputs} -> {result} (expected {expected})")
```

All four cases correct. Stacking perceptrons into layers creates decision boundaries that no single perceptron can produce.

## Use It

This two-layer XOR network is the seed of every deep neural network. What changes in modern networks:

- The step function becomes sigmoid, ReLU, or other smooth activations
- Weights are learned automatically via backpropagation (next lesson)
- Layers get deeper: 3, 10, 100+ layers
- The same principle holds: each layer creates new features from the previous layer's outputs

A single perceptron can only draw straight lines. Stack them, and you can draw any shape.

## Ship It

This lesson produces:
- `outputs/skill-perceptron.md` - a skill covering when single-layer vs multi-layer architectures are needed

## Exercises

1. Train a perceptron on a NAND gate (the universal gate - any logic circuit can be built from NAND). Verify its weights and bias form a valid decision boundary.
2. Modify the Perceptron class to track the decision boundary (w1*x1 + w2*x2 + b = 0) at each epoch. Print how the line shifts during training on the AND gate.
3. Build a 3-input perceptron that outputs 1 only when at least 2 of the 3 inputs are 1 (a majority vote function). Is this linearly separable? Why?
